# Ripples

## Getting Started
Run class named "RipplesApplication", which runs PApplet from data recorded by UPDRecorder as the default.

## Features
* There are circles designed to come from the head, hands and feet. They are marked in different colors. They grow in size and fade at a rate. 
* Head circles are constantly triggered.
* Hands circles are also constantly triggered, but cease when the interactor brings their hands together.
* Feet circles are triggered only when the interactor's feet are on the ground. It stops rippling if the hands come together.
